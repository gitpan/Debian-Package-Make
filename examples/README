Examples for Debian-Package-Make
================================

make-adobereader-package.pl

Builds a Debian package from the Adobe Reader tarball available from
<http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2_allversions_nojs1.html>.

The .deb available from the site installs everything into /opt which
made lintian quite unhappy.

This program uses Debian::Package::Make::TemplateDir and has been
tested only with AdobeReader_enu-8.1.1-1.i486.tar.bz2 so far.

make-bitdefender-package.pl

can do two things:

* build a bitdefender-scanner package from the self-extracting tarball
  available from http://www.bitdefender.com/

  It uses a template-based approach, as make-adobereader-package.pl,
  but it has to extract the tarball from the SFX first.

* build bitdefender-data packages, generated by invoking the
  bitdefender update process. This means that the bitdefender-scanner
  package has to be installed on the system.

  For the -data packages, the Debian::Package::Make::Debhelper module
  is used.
