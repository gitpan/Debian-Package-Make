Examples for Debian-Package-Make
================================

make-adobereader-package.pl
---------------------------

builds a Debian package from the Adobe Reader tarball available from
<http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2_allversions_nojs1.html>.

The .deb available from the site installs everything into /opt which
made lintian quite unhappy.

This program uses Debian::Package::Make::TemplateDir and has been
tested only with AdobeReader_enu-8.1.1-1.i486.tar.bz2 so far.

make-bitdefender-package.pl
---------------------------

can do two things:

* build a bitdefender-scanner package from the self-extracting tarball
  available from http://www.bitdefender.com/

  It uses a template-based approach, as make-adobereader-package.pl,
  but it has to extract the tarball from the SFX first.

* build bitdefender-data packages, generated by invoking the
  bitdefender update process. This means that the bitdefender-scanner
  package has to be installed on the system.

  For the -data packages, the Debian::Package::Make::Debhelper module
  is used.

make-avira-package.pl
---------------------

takes a slightly different approach since there are only 4 VDF files
with quite clear purpose.

It fetches the executable and VDF files from a tarball or an existing
installation directory, runs

    antivir --update

then

    antivir --check --update

and determines current version numbers from its output.

Individual packages (with individual version numbers) are then built
for antivir (the engine) and antivir-data-vdf0 through
antivir-data-vdf3.
