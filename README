Debian-Package-Make version 0.04
================================

Debian::Package::Make::* is a set of modules that simplify the process
of writing make-*-package programs (scripts that automatically
generate Debian packages).

This is useful for source distributions where contents change too
frequently for manual building or where peculiar licenses prohibit
redistribution via public package repositories.

I maintain Debian::Package::Make using git and I feed my changes to a
public repository on a regular basis.

This repository is available at
    git://git.debian.org/git/users/bengen/Debian-Package-Make.git
or

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires a few modules that are included in Perl distribution

  File::Temp
  File::Path
  File::Copy
  File::Find
  Text::Wrap
  Cwd

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  LWP
  File::Copy::Recursive
  IPC::Run
  dpkg-dev, preferably version 1.14 or above (see below)

The sample scripts in the contrib directory may require additional
modules.

NOTES

Compatibility module for older dpkg-dev versions

  Starting with 1.14, much of dpkg-dev has been refactored into Perl
  modules within the Dpkg:: namespace. Debian::Package::Make uses some
  functions that are exported from those modules, even though the
  dpkg-dev developers have marked them as not yet stable.

  For older systems, these functions (get_host_arch, parsecdata,
  parseversion) are provided by the Debian::Package::Make::Compat
  module.

dpkg-genchanges behavior

  The dpkg-dev packages that are part of etch and lenny (1.13.25 and
  1.14.16.6, respectively) contain dpkg-genchanges that expose
  different behavior if called with the the default `-si' switch:

  1.14.16:

    [...] the original source will be included only if the upstream
    version number (the version without epoch and without Debian
    revision) differs from the upstream version number of the previous
    changelog entry.

  1.13.25:

    [...] the original source will be included if the version number
    ends in -0 or -1, i.e. if the Debian revision part of the version
    number is 0 or 1.

  Debian::Package::Make does not handle this difference.
